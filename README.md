# ReynbOS-Website

You can use Linux Mint as an example of layout and requirements,
i like how minimalistic it is.

the site should be using bootstrap and try to mimic a clean almost material design guide,
avoid javascript's if possible. we dont need a huge library of javascripts.

if you have a design, please create a branch and a Pull Request and we can get different styles going and we'll work from there.
